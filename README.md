# divans_gui

divans_gui is a Front-end for Dropbox's [divANS compression program](https://github.com/dropbox/divans). It allows you to compress and extract files and folders.

When compressing folders, it actually compresses each file individually and stores it in the same location of the original file.

Released under the GPL 2.0 license. Feel free to tweak with this GUI!

Software written with Visual Studio 2017 in the Visual Basic .NET language
